## Overview

BrandAlign uses the power of Gemini to make sure that Google search ads are not violating brand policies and guidelines. It can verify headlines and descriptions in bulk and suggest an improved, rewritten ad copy that aligns with the specified rules, saving the customer time and keeping their brand message consistent. Additionally, image assets can be analysed to ensure they also match the brand's identity.

## Challenge Addressed

Large advertisers face a critical challenge: ensuring brand consistency across all their text ads, especially with content generated from diverse sources like AI, agencies, and partners. Manual review processes are not only inefficient and resource-intensive but also fail to guarantee compliance with complex brand guidelines. This leaves brands vulnerable to inconsistent messaging and reputational damage, highlighting the urgent need for a scalable and reliable solution that can automate ad verification and enforce brand standards across all advertising efforts.

## Outcome & Impact

With the power of Gemini BrandAlign checks all guidelines against the clients text ads. For each validation a reasoning why an ad might not adhere to a guideline will be created. Additionally BrandAlign will provide a new improved ad which is valid to all guidelines. BrandAlign works across many languages due to Geminiâ€™s multilinguality understanding in over 100 languages like Korean, French, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Chinese.
